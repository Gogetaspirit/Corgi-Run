# Corgi-Run

## Background
* Corgi Run is a web game inspired by temple run. Users will play as a "dog" and will have to navigate through obstacles by jumping.
Similar to temple run, the User will also be able to collect treats which will be added to their score. Once a user hits an obstacle the 
game will then be over.

## Functionality & MVP

* Start, pause, and restart functionalities
* User will be able to move left or right by using "a" and "d" keys and jump using "spacebar"
* Corgi will be able to collect treats and keep a tally of the number of treats collected.
* Obstacles will appear either from the sky dropping in or from a distance closing in.


## Wireframes

* This app will have a single screen with the map layout. Game controls will be listed on top. Directions on how to play and 
objectives will be listed on the right
* There will be a start, end, and reset button for the game as well.
* A nav bar will be included with my corresponding Github and LinkedIn links.
