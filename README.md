## Background
* Corgi Run is a web game inspired by temple run. Users will play as a "dog" and will have to navigate through obstacles by jumping.
Similar to temple run, the User will also be able to collect treats which will be added to their score. Once a user hits an obstacle the 
game will then be over.
